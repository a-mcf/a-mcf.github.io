subtitle: A bit about why I'm here

I've alwasy been an automation enthusiast. I wrote my first batch file in 1994 to launch DOOM with a two character command, and eventually graduated to writing scripts for my FidoNet-connected BBS. Years later, I got a job as a Windows System Administrator.

Being Windows focussed, I missed the begining of the DevOps revolution. When Linux admins were already managing their infrastructure as code with Chef and Puppet, I was still writing batch files, and occasionally, VBScript.

While I'd tinkered with PowerShell here and there, I didn't get serious until 2010, when I logged into my first Windows Server 2008 R2 machine and saw the blue icon on the task bar, occupying premium realestate. This told me that Microsoft was serious about PowerShell, and that I had better get going. Once I got my first taste, I never looked back.

Several years later, I watched Jeffery Snover give the keynote presentation at the PowerShell Summit. He spoke about how PowerShell "is all about DevOps". It was the first time I'd heard the term, so I went home and did a bit of Googling. My search lead me to a book called The [Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1#nav-subnav). It had great reviews, but a novel about IT Operations? Ouch. I added it to my wish list, but didn't read it for several months. When I finally did, I was shaken by the number of parallels to eperiences I'd had during my career. The challenges my team and I were facing weren't unique!

At work, we've improved quite a bit. There is constant progress, but there are also frequent setbacks. Occasionally I'll become frustrated, and question whether we are ever going to get there (wherever there is), but then I look back and see how far we've come. It's not easy to change hearts and minds, let alone decade old processes. It will take time.

Someday, I'll go to lunch after the fourth code change of the day runs through our CI/CD pipeline and is quietly deployed to our flagship application in production. While eating my salad, I'll pull out my smartphone and delete a production server. It won't matter, because the system will seamlessly route the traffic to functional servers. If load becomes an issue, new server will but automatically deployed. My coworkers and I will sit back, laugh, and marvel about our incredible journey.

Until then? I'll still be desperately seeking DevOps.
