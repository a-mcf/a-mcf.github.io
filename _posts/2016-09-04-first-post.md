While a general consensus of what DevOps is seems to exist within the community, the precise definition of DevOps is frequently debated. The eslusivene nature of an authortative definition brings to mind the Supreme Court of the United States' definition of obcenity ([I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it)). What most agree on however, is that it's a set of emerging best practices. One of my favorite ways to describe these is via an acronym coined by John Willis, Damon Edwards, and Jez Humble: [CALMS](http://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-1/).

CALMS stands for Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing. Previously, I had interpreted the sharing part to mean sharing withn your team or buisness, whether that meant sharing responsibility, information, tools, coffee, donuts, or whatever else.

Somewhere along the line (possibly on the [Arrested DevOps Podcast](https://www.arresteddevops.com/)), I heard sharing defined in terms that included contributing to open source, speaking, and even blogging. In other words, giving back to the community. Could I really improve my team by [sharing outside](http://themacro.com/articles/2016/05/why-the-best-give-away/) of it? As an introverted Windows IT pro working in an industry where being tight lipped is encouraged, all of these were somewhat inimicial to my natural tendencies. I've since come around, but was never sure about whether I could contribute something that was good enough, wouldn't waste the time of others, or wouldn't reflect negatively on me.

There are benefits to sharing beyond the altruistic buzz of contributing to the greater good. I expect that blogging will help sharpen my perspectives, sharing my code publicly will improve the quality of what I do by creating a feedback loop ([The Second Way](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/)), and all of this shows the world that my team and I are doing good work. Heck, maybe someday I'll speak in front of a users group.

This blog in general, and this post specifically are my way of trying to turn over a new leaf. While I expect most of my posts will be much more technically biased, this seemed an appropriate way to kick things off.

Hopefully you'll see me around. I'll try to avoid hiding in the future. How about you?
