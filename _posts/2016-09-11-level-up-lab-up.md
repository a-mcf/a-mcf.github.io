# Times Change
When I got started in IT I was one of the many that scoffed at the antiquated mainframe systems and paper processes that were still widely used. Some of the people performing those jobs were going to get run over by the IT revolution. While some were concerned, others were blissfully unaware, content in that their jobs were safe because they always had been. Organizations were looking to gain a competitive edge by standing up their own IT infrastructure, and a new wave of IT professionals emerged to make it happen. Eventually, the people using the old processes either adapted to the new technology, found new work, or retired. The world moved on. 

Years have passed since the dot-com boom. If we take an honest look at the industry, it's plain that on the average, in-house IT is terrible. The systems are cumbersome, the average IT shop doesn't understand the business, and is often unable to get out ouf it's own way enough to allow for any meaningful improvement. For someone in IT Ops, awareness of our poor performance makes watching the uptick in adoption of cloud services by corporations and governments that much more intimidating. Organizations are outsourcing more and more of their internal systems because they can attain superior solutions for less money, which in turn allows them to focus on their core business. Ten years ago, if you were an Exchange administrator, you were in the cat-bird’s seat. Now, you’re either very nervous, have learned additional disciplines, or are potentially in for a rude awakening. This isn't limited to mail, and the trend is only going to continue. We have become the bearers of antiquated processes and technology.

The good news is that information systems are becoming a larger and larger part of what organizations are doing. The bad news is that the sort of repetitive tasks that many of us have specialized in for years are being automated out of existence. There is still a [role for IT Operations]( https://blog.devopsguys.com/2015/06/30/what-does-the-future-of-it-operations-look-like-in-a-devops-world/), but it’s going to be different. It will no longer be focused on services that can be commoditized, but instead will be focused on those key applications that are actually business differentiators.

Staying relevant will require becoming familiar with what the business side of the house needs. It will mean understanding your company's key applications better than anyone else. It will mean managing distributed systems at scale. It will mean learning new tools and processes to make changes to production systems faster and more safely. It will mean getting out ahead of whats coming and facilitating change instead of getting swept up by it.

# Take Responsibility
New approaches require new skills, many of which can seem difficult to acquire if your organization is doing things the old way. While it is conveinient to blame your company for an antiquated skill set, it’s no excuse. You need to become an active participant in your career and elevate yourself. You need to [read](http://stevenmurawski.com/devops-reading-list/), you'll need to train, and you’ll need to spend at least some of your free time doing it. If you're serious about being good, this needs to be a continual processes. It's time to think in terms of personal [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen).

## Build a Lab
Nothing beats learning by doing. By building test environments, you can be more aggressive than you'd ever be on the company's servers, and you have a free hand to learn what you want. What you don't want to do is spend all of your time installing operating systems. This is something that you *already know* how to do. We need a way to quickly spin up lab environments so that we can break free of the drudgery and get to the good stuff, the stuff you *don't yet know* how to do.

In this series, we are going to explore different approaches to building Windows environments from code. This will allow us to create consistent, repeatable environments that can destroyed and rebuilt at will. This may sound intimidating, but there are tools to simplify the process and help us on the way.

In the next post, we'll start by taking a look at [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
